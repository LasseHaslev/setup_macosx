# Setup Macosx Script
Setup script for a fresh macosx installation

## Motivation

Reformating a mac can be pain, and the 3 worst steps of reformating your mac is:

1. Backup your files
2. Remember all the programs you should install
3. Searching up all the programs and installing them

I am using dropbox and gdrive for files, and git for all my projects. so step 1 is no longer a concern. and this script takes care of step 2 and 3.

## Installation

Run
```bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LasseHaslev/setup_macosx/master/install.sh)"```
Just sit back and watch your fresh install of macosx is beeng filled with your awsome programs. Just stick around your mack in case you have to interact with the script (password, paths and such).
